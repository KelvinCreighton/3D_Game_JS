# 3D Game in JS Canvas

This project was a fun experiment using what I learned from linear algebra in university to create a simple game prototype. It was done using only the canvas API and my own homebrew libraries. All the matrix and vector math was calculated and programmed by me.

## Usage

1. Run Game.html in your browser
2. Click inside the canvas to capture the mouse and allow the player to look around and ESC key to exit the mouse capture
3. Use the common WASD keys to control the player and move around and SPACE to jump
4. Other useful controls are SHIFT to sprint, R to reset the player, and I to toggle invert mouse
5. Hidden dev controls exist such as X to pause the game at the current frame, LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to rotate the camera in the Z axis, and UP and DOWN arrow keys to reset the camera's Z rotation
